## I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about the gaming indsutry today.

The video game industry is the economic sector involved in the development, marketing, and monetization of video games. 
It encompasses dozens of job disciplines and its component parts employ thousands of people worldwide. As of 2018, video
games generated sales of US$134.9 billion annually worldwide. Modern personal computers owe many advances and innovations 
to the game industry: sound cards, graphics cards and 3D graphic accelerators, faster CPUs, and dedicated co-processors 
like PhysX are a few of the more notable improvements.

## Scope Of Gaming Industry
Ben Sawyer of Digitalmill observes that the game industry value chain is made up of six connected and distinctive layers:

1. Capital and publishing layer: involved in paying for development of new titles and seeking returns through licensing of the titles.
2. Product and talent layer: includes developers, designers and artists, who may be working under individual contracts or as part of in-house development teams.
3. Production and tools layer: generates content production tools, game development middleware, customizable game engines, and production management tools.
4. Distribution layer: or the "publishing" industry, involved in generating and marketing catalogs of games for retail and online distribution.
5. Hardware (or Virtual Machine or Software Platform) layer: or the providers of the underlying platform, which may be console-based, accessed through online media, or accessed through mobile devices such as smartphones. This layer now includes network infrastructure and non-hardware platforms such as virtual machines (e.g. Java or Flash), or software platforms such as browsers or even further Facebook, etc.
6. End-users layer: or the users/players of the games.
